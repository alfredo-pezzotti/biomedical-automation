This software takes as input the numbers of the files 
whose values the user wants to be put in a .xls spreadsheet 
(e.g.: "02" for file argbase02.pdbqt).
It will output a table formatted in the following way:
    file0x.pdbqt    VALUE0x
    file0y.pdbqt    VALUE0y
Inside a file named Results.xls.

The script pymol2xls.py has to be put in the same directory as the
files to be checked. In the very same directory Results.xls will be
created.
