This software is used to automate the VINA software simulation generation
procedure.
It expects to find the VINA executable under:
    C:/AUTODOCKworkspace/vina.exe
will read VINA's input files from:
    C:/AUTODOCKworkspace/config.txt
and will generate simulation files under the current directory, with the
basename specified by the user and ".pdbqt" extension.
